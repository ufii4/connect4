# connect4
A console based two player game called connect4. The aim for both players is to make a straight line of four own pieces; the line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.
This used to be a lab project in the Uwaterloo course ECE 140. Despite the original lab instructions, I have refined this project by fixing some obvious bugs.
